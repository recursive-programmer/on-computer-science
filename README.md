And if you are a self-taught programmer like us, then it will be hugely beneficial for you to also learn about computer science fundamentals. And this repo exist to help you solve this particular problem.

This repo is divided into two big parts. The first part is the [theory part](./computer-science-theory), in which you will learn about computer science theories and the second part is the [puzzles](./puzzles), in which you can practice the knowledge you got from the fist part into various cases.
